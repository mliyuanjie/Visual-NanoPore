# Visual-NanoPore
a qt c++ software for nanopore data visualize and analysis. 
provide quite fast algorithm for interacting visualize of large data upto 3 GB. therotically, the size of data can be handle even large, 10 GB also possible. 
provide a real-time analysis for the data with a high speed, based on two statistic sliding window. test on 1.8Ghz cpu, single threads could process the data with a ~2000 Mb/s speed. the algorithm O(N).
provide a manual events correction, and vis.
